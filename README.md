Here is a simple footnote[^check].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^check]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
